\section*{HUNTER \tile{0cm 0.5cm 1.55cm 4.05cm}}
This is you. A HUNTER that hunts GRAZERs. Use direction keys to move. SPACE
key will skip one EPOCH remaining on the same spot. Holding ENTER key will
fast forward simulation into the future.
\section*{EMPTY}
EMPTY space does not contain anything, but it has all the potential to
contain something. GRASS can grow there. HUNTER can move in there.
ROCK can be rolled there. Disasters may happen in there.
\section*{GRASS \tile{0.5cm 4.5cm 0cm 0cm}}
If there is GRASS next to EMPTY space it will disseminate into that
EMPTY space in next EPOCH. GRASS always atracts GRAZERs. Walking into GRASS
or rolling ROCK there will destroy it.
\section*{GRAZER \tile{0cm 3.0cm 1.55cm 1.55cm}}
GRAZERs eat GRASS and become fatter. Once they are fat enough they reproduce.
If there is no GRASS, then grazers become thinner, seek to migrate or die
out of hunger if they can not find any GRASS. \\ Without intervention from HUNTER,
populations usually collapse.

HEALTH of a GRAZER can be gauged by fatness of it's belly. It is either one, two
or three pixels wide. Once it's three pixels fat, GRAZER will reproduce and put
it's offspring in adjacent square, but only if there is GRASS in it.

  \tile{0.0cm 3.0cm 1.55cm 1.55cm}
}
Amount of GRASS left under GRAZER can be gauged by how high it holds it's head
looking for new pastures. Highest head position means all GRASS is gone and
GRAZER would either migrate or starve.
\section*{ROCK \tile{1.0cm 0.5cm 0.55cm 4.05cm}}
ROCK can be rolled into GRASS, SAND or EMPTY space by pushing it from opposite
direction. ROCKs are not only obstacles, but also useful tools for altering
environmental dynamics.
\section*{SAND \fence{3.0cm 4.0cm 0.55cm 0.0cm}}
SAND is not fertile. Nothing grows in sand. Although HUNTER can move in there
and ROCK can be rolled there. GRAZERs have no interest in checking out square
that has no GRASS in it.
\section*{WATER \fence{3.5cm 4.0cm 0.0cm 0.0cm}}
WATER is a treacherous element. Nothing can move into WATER space, but WATER
can move into GRAZER or HUNTER space and drown it. ROCKs sometimes
can block WATER currents if they are not too strong.
